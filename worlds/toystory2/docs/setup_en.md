# Toy Story 2 - Setup Guide

This guide walks you through installing and playing the Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear
to the Rescue randomizer for Archipelago.

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases). Please use
  version 0.6.7 or later for integrated BizHawk support.
- A legally obtained copy of **Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue** (PS1,
  NTSC-U, serial `SCUS-94464`) as an ISO or BIN/CUE image. Other regions are **not**
  supported.
- [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory) 2.10 or later (the latest
  release is recommended). Other emulators are **not** supported.
- The latest `toystory2.apworld`. Put this in your `Archipelago/custom_worlds`
  folder.
- The `ts2.lua` game script (distributed alongside the apworld).

## Configuring BizHawk

Once you have installed BizHawk, open `EmuHawk.exe` and change the following
settings:

- Under `Config > Customize`, check the "Run in background" option to prevent
  disconnecting from the client while you're tabbed out of EmuHawk.
- Under `Config > Preferred Cores > PSX`, select **Nymashock**.
- Open any PlayStation game in EmuHawk and go to `Config > Controllers…` to
  configure your inputs. If you can't click `Controllers…`, it's because you need to
  load a game first.
- Consider clearing keybinds in `Config > Hotkeys…` if you don't intend to use them.
  Select the keybind and press Esc to clear it.

## Installing the APWorld

1. Double-click `toystory2.apworld`, or place it in your Archipelago install at
   `Archipelago/custom_worlds/`.
2. Launch `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` once so it registers the world. You should now
   find **"Toy Story 2 Client"** in the list on the right side.

## Generating a Game

1. Create your options file (YAML). After installing the `toystory2.apworld` file,
   you can generate a template within the Archipelago Launcher by clicking
   `Generate Template Settings`.
2. Follow the general Archipelago instructions for
   [generating a game](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game).
3. Open `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`.
4. Select **"Toy Story 2 Client"** in the right-side column.

## Connecting to a Server

1. Open EmuHawk.
2. Open your Toy Story 2 (NTSC-U) ISO or CUE file in EmuHawk and let it boot. Press
   Start at the first title screen to reach the **title screen after pressing Start**
   (the main menu). It is safe to sit here — pressing Start does not enter your save
   (see the important note below about *when* to load the scripts).
3. In EmuHawk, go to `Tools > Lua Console`. This window must stay open while playing.
   Be careful to avoid clicking "TAStudio" below it in the menu, as this is known to
   delete your savefile.
4. In the Lua Console window, go to `Script > Open Script…`.
5. Navigate to your Archipelago install folder and open
   `data/lua/connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` **first**.
6. Then open **`ts2.lua`** (the Toy Story 2 game script) **second**. Order matters:
   always load the connector before `ts2.lua`.
7. The emulator and client will eventually connect to each other. The Toy Story 2
   Client window should indicate that it connected and recognized Toy Story 2.
8. To connect the client to the server, enter your room's address and port (e.g.
   `archipelago.gg:38281`) into the top text field of the client and click Connect.

You should now be able to receive and send items. You'll need to do these steps
every time you want to reconnect.

## IMPORTANT: Load the Scripts on the Title Screen (After Pressing Start)

> **Load the Lua scripts (`connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` and `ts2.lua`) while the
> game is on the TITLE SCREEN AFTER PRESSING START.**

There are technically two title screens. The first is the initial splash; pressing
Start there takes you to the **second title screen** (the main menu). Pressing Start
to reach this menu is safe and does **not** enter your save, so it's the ideal place
to load the scripts.

Your starting items (starting moves, starting levels, laser, etc.) are applied when
the scripts first attach. If the Lua is loaded while the game is on anything other
than this title screen — for example mid-level, on the level-select map, or during a
cutscene — your starting inventory may not be applied correctly, and the game can
behave as if you have nothing.

To avoid this:

1. Boot the game and press Start to reach the **title screen after pressing Start**
   (the main menu). Do not start a save yet.
2. **Only then** load `connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` and `ts2.lua` in the Lua
   Console.
3. Connect the Toy Story 2 Client to the server.
4. Start your save / enter the game normally.

## IMPORTANT: Reconnect on the Map or Title Screen, Not Mid-Level

> **When you need to reconnect or reload the scripts, do it from the level-select
> map or the title screen — never in the middle of a level.**

When the client reconnects, it re-syncs your full state (received items, checked
locations, and so on) back into the game. If this happens **while you are inside a
level**, the re-sync can collide with the level's own in-progress state and cause
incorrect behavior (for example, mis-set coin counts or checks that look wrong until
you leave and re-enter).

To re-sync safely:

1. Return to the **level-select map** (or the **title screen**) before reconnecting,
   reloading the Lua, or restarting BizHawk.
2. Reconnect the client (or reload `connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` then `ts2.lua`,
   in that order).
3. Wait for the client to report that it has connected and re-synced.
4. Then enter a level as normal.

It is perfectly safe to make progress offline; everything will re-sync the next time
you connect — just do that connection from the map or title screen.

## Death Link (optional)

If you enable Death Link in your YAML, dying in your game sends a death to everyone
else with Death Link enabled, and their deaths will kill you. Deaths received while
you are not in a playable level are queued and applied once you are back in a level.

## Ending a Session

- Toy Story 2 does not automatically save your progress for you. When you're done
  playing, either save your game to a virtual memory card (recommended) or make a
  savestate to resume later. When reconnecting later, Archipelago will send you any
  items you received while you were disconnected — just reconnect from the map or
  title screen as described above.

## Troubleshooting

- **No starting items / nothing unlocked:** You most likely loaded the Lua off the
  title screen. Return to the title screen after pressing Start (the main menu),
  reload `connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` then `ts2.lua`, and reconnect.
- **Coin counts, checks, or unlocks look wrong after reconnecting:** You may have
  reconnected or reloaded the scripts while inside a level. Return to the map or
  title screen and reconnect from there; the state will re-sync correctly.
- **Client says connected but nothing happens:** Make sure you loaded
  `connector_bizhawk_generic.lua` *before* `ts2.lua`, and that the Toy Story 2
  Client is pointed at the correct game.
- **Wrong game/version:** This randomizer targets the NTSC-U release
  (`SCUS-94464`). Other regions are not supported.
